# Setting Up GitHub Pages for Live Demo

To make your game playable directly from a URL, follow these steps to set up GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your repository page: https://github.com/Awesomepieman69/hyper-space-game
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Pages"
4. Under "Build and deployment" section, select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Under "Branch", select "main" and "/(root)" folder, then click "Save"
6. Wait a few minutes for the deployment to complete
7. Your game will be available at: https://awesomepieman69.github.io/hyper-space-game/

Once deployed, you can share this URL with anyone to let them play your game directly in their browser without downloading any files!

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
- Make sure all files are in the root directory (index.html, style.css, game.js, etc.)
- Check that the repository is public
- Verify that the GitHub Pages service is active (sometimes there's a delay in deployment)
- Look at the "Actions" tab for any deployment errors
